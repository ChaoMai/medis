# Veloce

## What's Veloce?

A high performance key-value storage.

Now, the following commands are supported:

* connection: echo, ping, select
* string: set, setnx, get

## Motivation

This project is a practice about Linux programming (first step).

And I will combine lock-free, distribute system and other knowledge to archive high performance (second step).

# Installation

scons
cd build/release/bin
