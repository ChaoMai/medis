# Medis

## What's Medis?

A high performance key-value storage.

## Motivation

> Talk is cheap. Show me the Code.

I call myself a Linux C++ programmer, but sadly I haven't write much code in Linux using C++.

This project is a practice about Linux programming (first step).

And I will combine lock-free, distribute system and other knowledge to archive high performance (second step).
